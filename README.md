# Guitar-Logic  

Guitar-Logic is a tool to diagnose chords and scales on a virtual fretboard.  
  
Currently, it only diagnoses major and minor chords. Actively working on extending support to diagnose a wider variety of chords.  
  
Guitar-Logic can currently calculate scale notes and positions, but not display or diagnose them on the virtual fretboard.  

# Planned Features:  

- Write your own tabs using the virtual keyboard  
- See all scales for a certain key signature  
- Search for a specific scale  
- Diagnose sclaes by supplying notes  
- Build and save your own scales and arpeggios  
- API for other sites to use  

# Interested? Wanna help? Good with music theory?  

If any of those describe you, I'd love to hear from you. This is a casual, open source, exploratory project. If you feel you hav something to contribute, just open an issue.    
  
I've written and rewritten the code in a couple of different languages, so if you're a java, ruby, or javascript person, feel free to contribute  
to any of those codebases.  
  
If you're simply interested in the project and want to use it, feel free to open an issue for a feature and I'll add it to my todo list.  
  
Thanks for reading!
