#Guitar-Logic  

A command line tool used to provide developer/guitarists with quick access to scale theory, chord theory, key signature data, and other songwriting/learning utilities through a cli tab interface  

#Planned Features:  

Import tabs from ultimate guitar and view them in your commanbd prompt  
Write your own tabs  
See all scales for a certain key signature  
Search for a specific scale  
Type in notes to find all scales with those notes  
Build and save your own scales and arpeggios  

# Next Steps

Begin construction. Anyone who wants to help or has any suggestions as far as features go please feel free to contact me.  
Yes, it is simply a cli tool for now. Yes, I am going to turn it into a web application if I like the way it works.
